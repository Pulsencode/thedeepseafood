            collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting
            on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
            Services.

        </ul>
        <h4 id="section4">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information
            when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our
            Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for
            analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to
            your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences).
            The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and
            services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in

            <strong>Google Analytics</strong>
        </p>
        <p>

        <h4 id="section5">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy
            Notice unless otherwise required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
            or other legal requirements).
        </p>
        <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
            or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
            from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>
        <h4 id="section6">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical
            security measures.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to
            protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
            secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
            be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
            within a secure environment.
        </p>
        <h4 id="section7">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h4>

        </p>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we
            knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or
            that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the
            Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
            will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If
            you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
            <a href="mailto:info@thedeepseafood.com">info@thedeepseafood.com</a>.
        </p>
        <h4 id="section8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country,
            province, or state of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may
            be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
            consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
            provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
            when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
            on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
        </p>

        <h4 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
        <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT')
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising
            and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
            signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
            standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
            practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
        </p>
        <h4 id="section10">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
            'Revised' date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may
            notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
            We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
            information.
