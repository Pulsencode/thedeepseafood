## Setting up environment

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (preferably version 3.11.7 or above)
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended for creating isolated Python environments)

**Create a Virtual Environment**

> [!CAUTION]
> Not creating a virtual environment can lead to project instability.

Creating a virtual environment helps isolate your project dependencies from other Python projects on your system. To create a virtual environment, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activating the environment

- For windows
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
- For macOS and Linux
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

**Installing all the required libraries**

Now that you have a virtual environment set up, you can install Django and other libraries required within the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Copy the env file**

You will need to create a copy of the .env.example file with the name .env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
This will create a copy of the env file and then you can edit the contents of this file

**Running the project in your local system**

Before running ensure that the :
1. Virtual Environment is activated

Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Then a super user has to be created
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Then run the program in the development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```


**Development Requirements**
1. Needed Extensions
    1.1. Flake8
    1.2. mypy

2. Running pre commit before a commit

Only Clean when needed

```bash
pre-commit install
```

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

```bash
pre-commit clean
```
## Dockerization
- Run Docker Init
```bash
docker init
```
- this will create all the required files for dockerization
- Run the build command
```bash
docker build -tag django-template:latest .
```
- Change the tag name to the desired name
- This will create an image for the application

- To run the image
```bash
docker run --env-files .env --name django-template -d -p 8000:8000 django-template:latest
```

## Run Test

```bash
python manage.py test
```
